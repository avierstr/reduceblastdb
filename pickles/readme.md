These files contain the "removed" and "unique" accessions that already have been compared during a "reduce" of (a part of) the database (`-r , --reduce`) that I have done myself.  There is no need that everybody has to redo the comparisons to end up with the same results, so this is why the results are saved.  The initial comparisons takes up a lot of time (e.g. for bacteria it took more than a month on 20 cores).  Running it again with these files reduces the time to a few hours or days.

These files are automatically downloaded when someone does a reduction of the database so that the reduction goes much faster if that part has already been done (only newly added accessions have to be compared).  I will try to update these files from time to time if I have done more reductions.  The 'reduceblastdb' script does not send me the the files if someone has done a reduction, feel free to send me a message if you want to send me reduction files.

These files contain the "removed" and "unique" information for:
 - nucleotide sequences:
	 * bacteria (almost complete Okt 2024)
	 * insecta (almost complete Okt 2024)
 - protein sequences:
    * none
